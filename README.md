# Web Components with StencilJS

The code in this repository was used in a presentation given to the [JsHeroes community](https://www.meetup.com/jsheroes/) in Cluj-Napoca, Romania.

Please note that this is a simple example that demonstrates how to implement web components using StencilJS, and how to integrate them with some front-end frameworks like Angular and ReactJS.
